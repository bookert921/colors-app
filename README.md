# COLOR SWATCH APP

A challenge from Helpful Human (see challenge https://github.com/HelpfulHuman/interview-challenge).

## Features

### \* Search a paginated database of 100 colors.

### \* Click on colors swatches to view details.

### \* Find random colors.

## Overview

The project challenge required you to create an API (https://github.com/bookert921/colors-server) with a pagination of about 100 colors. For this, I used Node/ExpressJs and PostgreSQL/Sequelize for my server and database. Then, create a fontend to display a list view and details view of each of the colors with a hex value title.

As a bonus you could create a graphQL endpoint, generate color list from a script (group colors by their values into red, yellow, grey, etc.), or make it responsive.

All things considered you have 2-3 days to deliver and this is what I came up with in that timeframe.
